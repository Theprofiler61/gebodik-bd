# 📚 gebodik-bd - A Simple Database for Learning

## 🏷️ Overview
gebodik-bd is a minimal educational relational database management system (RDBMS) built in Java 17. This project offers an easy way to learn how databases operate. You will find a custom SQL processing pipeline that includes the lexer, parser, semantic analysis, query planning, optimization, and execution. The system also features a storage engine with heap pages, a buffer pool, and supports indexing through B-trees and hashes.
